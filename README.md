# Dog Pound 🐾

## Overview:
This Android game is a fun twist on the classic Whac-A-Mole arcade game for the Boston University community. The player has 15 seconds to tap (or click) as many terriers as they can to gain points while avoiding the impostor eagles that take points back. 

## My Role: 
I completed this project within a month for my Boston University [Introduction to Software Engineering](https://www.bu.edu/academics/eng/courses/eng-ec-327/) class alongside 3 other peers: Eve Cruanes, Kayla Smith, and Makayla Tajalle.

I specifically worked as the Interface Lead, focusing on creating a simple, intuitive, and enjoyable experience for a younger targeted audience. This included designing many of the assets in **Adobe Illustrator**, curating the music and sound effects, and configuring the page layouts and design with basic **XML**. 

Back-end **Java**

## Setup*:
1. Download the file and unzip it in your desired location.
2. In Android Studio, open the “dogpound” file as a project.
3. Select a device to run the application on and press the green play button in the top right corner.
4. The application will load with the logo and instructions for the game will display.

*Android Studio needed to preview the application
