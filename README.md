# Dog Pound

## Overview üîç:
This Android game is a fun twist on the classic Whac-A-Mole arcade game for the Boston University community. The player has 15 seconds to tap (or click) as many terriers as they can to gain points while avoiding the impostor eagles that take points back. 

## My Role üöß: 
I completed this project within a month for my Boston University [Introduction to Software Engineering](https://www.bu.edu/academics/eng/courses/eng-ec-327/) class alongside 3 other peers: Eve Cruanes, Kayla Smith, and Makayla Tajalle.

Specifically, I worked as the _Interface Lead_, focusing on creating a simple, intuitive, and enjoyable experience for a younger targeted audience. This included designing many of the assets in **Adobe Illustrator**, integrating the music and sound effects, and configuring the page layouts and design with basic **XML**. 

I also programmed a bit of the back-end code in **Java** which involved setting up the page navigation system with Activities and Intents, creating fuctions for makeshift animation of assets, and configuring the point scoring system.

## Setup* ‚öôÔ∏è:
1. Download the file and unzip it in any desired location.
2. Open the now unzipped ‚Äúdogpound‚Äù folder as a project in Android Studio.
3. Once the application builds, select a device to run it on and press the green play button in the top right corner.
4. The application will open with the logo and instructions for the game should display.
